# Mod11Chall
Repo for Week 11 Challenge of Fintech Course in which I attempt to create various forecasts for a company, specifically for google search trends and revenue. There is also some more straightforward isolating of cyclical trends .

## Technologies
This code was written using Python 3.7.13. I had to utilize google colab for various purposes, mainly because some of the code is expensive and is better run in the cloud. 

My OS is Ventura 13.2.1 though it should be fine on most others. Note that the CLI in any screenshots may look different on different OSs.

I used conda to manage all of my packages.
Packages used:
Prophet
Holoviews
Pystan


---
## Installation
I do not recommend installing these packages. Rather, I would recommend a local install utilizing !pip install like you can observe in the forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb notebook.

### Usage
The goal of this project is to identify historical arbitrage opportunities for bitcoin. We compare the price history for bitcoin from two exchanges and identify areas in which profitable arbitrage exists. 

Code can be found in the following notebook [forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb](https://github.com/wcolwellcol/Mod11Chall/blob/main/forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb).

Data for this project is sourced from three csvs found in the [resources](https://github.com/wcolwellcol/Mod11Chall/tree/main/Resources) folder.
